  utter_ask_rp_continue:
  - text: Thank you for answering the questions. In order to understand the role of
      each one of us in cybersecurity, we are going to do some role playing, is that
      OK? (Please try to give me direct answers)
  utter_default:
  - text: Sorry, I didn't get that, can you rephrase?
  - text: Not sure I follow, sorry. What do you mean?
  - text: Would you mind saying that a bit differently for me please?
  - text: Sorry, I'm lost. Can you repeat that another way?
  utter_background:
  - text: So, first let me give you some background on what happened in the last few
      days. At the Imagine NHS Trust, all IT systems went down for 48 hours last week
      leading to ¬£2 billion pounds in loses, 3000 appointments cancelled and 600 planned
      surgeries to be postponed. As the scale of the security breach became clear
      on Thursday afternoon, ambulances were diverted and patients told to avoid some
      A&amp;E departments. Staff reverted to pen and paper and used their own mobiles
      after key systems were affected (including telephones). The Home Secretary has
      now confirmed that all the NHS IT systems working and no patient records were
      accessed. Scary story isn't it?
  utter_birthday_query:
  - text: Anyway, as I said, I‚Äôm Ali from the IT team at the Imagine NHS Trust. And
      you are {name}, one of our nurses in the Trust, right? Your birthday was 2 weeks
      ago and you had a party at Jamcaf√© where you met Alex Smith. Is this correct?
  utter_disbelief:
  - text: Wow, ok, I'm surprised! This is scary stuff you know!
  - text: I can't believe you don't appear to be shocked by this.
  utter_fiction_story:
  - text: I know it's fiction, and that never happened to you, but you can at least
      pretend that it happened that way. So, let me continue with the story.
  utter_guess_what_happened:
  - text: Alex received an email the next day with title "You made my birthday so
      special". In the body of the text said "Keep the attached photo as a memory
      of the night"! And guess what they did.
  utter_positive_reaction:
  - text: We wish that Alex did that first. Things might be totally different.
  utter_clarify_email_sender:
  - text: We know that you didn't send that email, but, regrettably, Alex tried to
      open the image. The attachment was actually a virus. The virus quickly spread
      resulting in the 48 hour shutdown of the systems. Someone worked out that the
      two of you had just met, and exploited the situation in sending an email to
      Alex. It is terrifying, isn't it?
  utter_why_not_terrifying:
  - text: Why it is not terrifying?
  utter_guess_how_happened:
  - text: What do you think happened? How did they find out about you and Alex?
  utter_please_dont_worry:
  - text: Please don't worry, no-one is watching you. Well, at least the real you...
  utter_social_media:
  - text: Yes, social media is responsible for that.
  utter_who_posted_it:
  - text: Someone saw the pictures from your birthday party on Instagram and Facebook.
      I bet that you are wondering how that even happened since you didn't even post
      anything. Well, unfortunately your friend Chelsie did. Do you know that there
      is a lot of software that can do that?
  utter_social_mapping_tools:
  - text: There are some tools available to anyone that can gather someone's information
      from LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, and even from Chinese
      Weibo and Douban, and Russian VKontakte. The most well-known one is Social Mapper.
      You can see details here about that software https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lOf-kUELkg
  utter_someone_monitoring:
  - text: I bet now you are thinking that someone is monitoring your social media
      accounts? And found all your personal information, right?
  utter_doubt_in_monitoring:
  - text: So you don't care if someone steals your credit or debit card? Or even end
      up in jail as a result of someone stealing your data?
  utter_how_to_prevent:
  - text: So, what could you do in order this not to happen again?
  utter_good_prevention:
  - text: That's a good plan. You can change your settings so only your friends can
      see your posts.
  utter_poor_prevention:
  - text: If you do nothing, then someone can steal your identity and the consequences
      could be worse the next time!
  utter_fair_prevention:
  - text: I'm not saying that you shouldn't post anything work related, but allowing
      everyone to see your personal photos can easily allow someone to combine information
      from your social media accounts to gather a holistic view of your online identity.
      Where do you work? Who are your colleagues? Which colleages are also friends?
      What big events are happening in your life? And so on...
  utter_phishing_question:
  - text: When hackers don't have access to your account, they cannot send phishing
      emails. Do you know what phishing emails are?
  utter_aware_phishing:
  - text: Good. Please see here if you want [further information on phishing](https://keepitconfidential.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Phishing_Final_1.webmhd.webm)
  utter_unaware_phishing:
  - text: Phishing is the fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information such
      as usernames, passwords and credit card details by disguising as a trustworthy
      entity in an electronic communication. Typically carried out by email spoofing,
      instant messaging, and directs users to enter personal information on a fake
      website (the look and feel of which are identical to the legitimate site). See
      more on [phishing](https://keepitconfidential.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Phishing_Final_1.webmhd.webm)
  utter_feel_better:
  - text: /{name}/, do you feel better now?
  utter_it_happens_alot:
  - text: You should not feel bad. It happens more often that you can imagine, so
      just make sure that you set the privacy settings on your accounts and check
      them every now and then. For example, updating the Facebook app might revert
      the setting to its default, so be aware that every time you update or change
      device you should check the privacy settings.
  utter_dont_reveal_much:
  - text: I'd also suggest not to reveal too much personal information on social media.
      We all like the "Likes" and "Shares" from friends, but we should be careful
      on what we are sharing.
  utter_nhs_policy_question:
  - text: Do you know that NHS has a policy on social media?
  utter_familiar_nhs_policy:
  - text: If you haven't seen it recently, I'd suggest reading the "3.2.1 Safeguarding
      Yourself" section for up-to-date information. Please see [the NHS social media
      policy](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-media-policy.pdf)
  utter_unfamiliar_nhs_policy:
  - text: I'd suggest reading the "3.2.1 Safeguarding Yourself" section from [the
      NHS social media policy](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-media-policy.pdf)
