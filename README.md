This is the GitHub repository for the cybersecurity chatbot as part of implementation for the CEPEH project (https://cepeh.eu/).

User testing is available at:
http://cepeh1.med.auth.gr/guest/conversations/production/0f782a38be074d22b809143ad857e5df

Latest updates:
- Removed unnecessary slots
- Removed random words intent as this is really hard to produce enough data that would not influence the conversation
- Tidied up the domain and config files
- Added more data
- Retrained bot and deployed new model
